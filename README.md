Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Project

This project explores the Titanic disaster dataset using various machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival. We have implemented and compared 11 different algorithms to determine the most effective model for this classification task.

Overview

The Titanic dataset provides information on passengers such as age, sex, class, etc. Our goal is to use this data to predict survival rates. The following 11 algorithms have been applied:

Logistic Regression ,
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ,
Support Vector Machines (SVM) ,
Decision Tree Classifier ,
Random Forest Classifier ,
Gradient Boosting Classifier ,
AdaBoost Classifier ,
Naive Bayes ,
Extra Trees Classifier ,
XGBoost, 
LightGBM 

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
Comparison of Algorithms: Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Results

The performance of each algorithm was compared to determine the best model. Key metrics and visualizations of model performance are included to provide insights into their effectiveness.

Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection in predictive analytics. By comparing multiple algorithms, we gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations in the context of the Titanic dataset.
